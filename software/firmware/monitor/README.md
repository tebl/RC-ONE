# KIM-1 Monitor
The KIM-1 monitor is the original software as was included within the ROM-sections of the two 6530-chips found on the KIM-1 computer, it holds a lot of the essence of what a KIM-1 computer actually is; meaning it coordinates the various inputs and outputs on the machine and how they interact. While Commodore owned the original copyright I do not know who owns it today, but as the code was included with the manuals sold with the machine I assume it is OK as long as everyone understands that I did originally write it and it is probably owned by someone, somewhere.

With that out of the way, the source files found within this directory was made by parsing through the source listing from the already mentioned [KIM-1 User Guide](http://users.telenet.be/kim1-6502/6502/usrman.html#I). This document, as well as loads more of relevant and interesting documents related to the KIM-1 computer can also be found on [Hans Otten's KIM-1 pages](http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/kim-1-manuals-and-software/kim-1-manuals-and-software/).

Some changes have been made here and there, mostly because my assembler of choice ([SB-Assembler 3](https://www.sbprojects.net/sbasm/index.php)) have slight differences in syntax and so the source looks slightly different in some places. I've also had a read-through of the source as listed by [Ruud Baltissen](http://www.baltissen.org/newhtm/src_kim.htm) and in some places I've included some of his comments on the code, but I've chosen to reformat his comments so that they fit more with the original source material. The resulting binary files have been compared to dumps of the original source files and they should be identical.
