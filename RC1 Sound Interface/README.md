# RC-ONE Sound Interface (SID)

**This design is untested!**

Made in order to use Commodore 64 SID chip replacements such as the SwinSID, armSID or fpgaSID as a sound device. Purposefully does not include the extra voltages needed to use a real SID-chip, mostly because the functioning chips that are left in this world belong in real computers (also, did not want to mess around with more than one power rail).
